ICIS-Air contains emissions, compliance, and enforcement data on stationary sources of air pollution. Regulated sources cover a wide spectrum; from large industrial facilities to relatively small operations such as dry cleaners (automobiles and other mobile air pollution sources are tracked by a different EPA system).

We will utilize the ICIS-Air Dataset to predict Clean Air Act violations.

As of right now, the dataset is too large to upload.
